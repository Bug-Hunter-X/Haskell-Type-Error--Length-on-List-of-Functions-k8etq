This repository demonstrates a common type error in Haskell when using the `length` function on a list of functions. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` shows the corrected version. The issue arises because functions in Haskell are polymorphic, and a list of functions may contain functions with varied input and output types. This violates the type constraint imposed by the `length` function, which requires a homogenous list.
