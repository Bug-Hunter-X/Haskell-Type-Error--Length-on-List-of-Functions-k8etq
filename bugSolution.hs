The solution is to avoid applying `length` directly to a list of functions. Instead, you need to either make the list homogeneous by using type annotations or by using a function that works on a list of polymorphic type. A simple solution is to just iterate over the list and use `map` to perform the operation on each function. If you only need to know whether there are any items in the list, you should use a function like `null`.
